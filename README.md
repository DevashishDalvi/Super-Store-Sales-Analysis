# SuperStore Sales Analytics üìäüõçÔ∏è

Welcome to the **SuperStore Sales Analytics** project! This repository showcases my data analytics skills using real-world data from a retail store in the United States. The dataset covers the period from **January 2014 to December 2017**.

## üìñ Project Description

The project involves analyzing sales data to uncover insights about customer behavior, product performance, and regional trends. Through this analysis, I demonstrate the use of Python libraries and visualization techniques to extract meaningful information from raw data.

## üìë Data Source

The dataset was obtained from the [Tableau Community Forum](https://community.tableau.com/s/question/0D54T00000CWeX8SAL/sample-superstore-sales-excelxls) and includes detailed sales records of a store operating in the United States.
